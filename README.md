This project demonstrates the development of a Diabetes Prediction System using machine learning techniques. It incorporates end-to-end processes from data preprocessing to model deployment, making it a practical and user-friendly solution for predicting whether a person has diabetes based on specific health parameters.

Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and processed the dataset to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the data for machine learning.
2. Model Development: Trained a Random Forest Classifier to achieve accurate predictions. The model was evaluated and tuned for optimal performance.
3. Predictive System: Built a robust predictive system that classifies whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic based on the input features.
4. Pickle Integration: Saved the trained model as a pickle file for efficient loading and deployment.
5. Web App: Designed a Streamlit-based web interface to make the prediction system user-friendly. The UI allows users to input their health parameters and view predictions instantly.
6. Interactive UI: Developed a clean and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction, ensuring accessibility for users with minimal technical expertise.

Technologies Used
1. Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
2. Web Framework: Streamlit
3. Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
4. Model Deployment: Pickle
5. Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (if applicable)
